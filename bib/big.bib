  abstract = {An increasing amount of valuable data sources, advances in Internet
	of Things and Big Data technologies as well as the availability of
	a wide range of machine learning algorithms offers new potential
	to deliver analytical services to citizens and urban decision makers.
	However there is still a gap in combining the current state-of-the
	art in an integrated framework that would help reducing development
	costs and enable new kind of services. In this chapter we show how
	such an integrated Big Data analytical framework for Internet of
	Things and Smart City application could look like. The contributions
	of this chapter are threefold: (1) we provide an overview of Big
	Data and Internet of Things technologies including a summary of their
	relationships, (2) we present a case study in the smart grid domain
	that illustrates the high level requirements towards such an analytical
	Big Data framework, and (3) we present an initial version of such
	a framework mainly addressing the volume and velocity challenge.
	The findings presented in this chapter are extended results from
	the EU funded project BIG and the German funded project PEC.},
