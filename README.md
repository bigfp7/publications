publications
============

In order to upload publications references to the website, contact me with your github.com account, I add it to the bigfp7 organization on github and then you can clone the publications repository with write access over ssh or https and add the publications to bib/big.bib and then execute either upload.bat (on Windows) or upload.sh (on Linux or Unix based Macs).
