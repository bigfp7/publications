publications
============

In order to add publications, you need to use Git and follow the steps below. If you don't have the technical knowledge to do so, please write an email to Konrad with the bibtex entry and the attached pdf and he will do it for you. If you do not have and cannot create a bibtex entry, provide all information you have, including title, author names in correct order, conference or book name, pages, year.

- give Konrad your github account, so he can add you to https://github.com/orgs/bigfp7
- log in to git, clone https://github.com/bigfp7/publications with write access over SSH or https
- add the publication pdf to the 2013 or 2014 folder (create 2013 folder if not existing)
- add the bibtex entry of it to bib/big.bib
- execute either upload.bat (on Windows) or upload.sh (on Linux or Unix based Macs)
- commit and push the changes

All references of the Big project need to contain the keyword "big-318062" and a URL to the PDF version.
