publications
============

In order to add publications, there are two possibilities:

1. (the simple one) Using Bibsonomy
- log in to http://www.bibsonomy.org/ using "bigfp7" as login. The password is the same as for the BIG twitter and bit.ly
- add the publication using the tag "big-318062", please provide a persistent download URL (if not existing you can add it to git, see method 2, this is actually preferable even if you have another download link as then we have all publications in one place)

2. Using Git
- give Konrad your github account, so he can add you to https://github.com/orgs/bigfp7
- log in to git, clone https://github.com/bigfp7/publications with write access over SSH or https
- add the publication pdf to the 2013 or 2014 folder (create 2013 folder if not existing)
- add the bibtex entry of it to bib/big.bib
- execute either upload.bat (on Windows) or upload.sh (on Linux or Unix based Macs)
- commit and push the changes

All references of the Big project need to contain the keyword "big-318062" and a URL to the PDF version.
